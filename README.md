# Getting_and_Cleaning_Data_Assignment
Purpose: The purpose of this repo is to house the R source code, code book, and scripts as required for the Getting and Cleaning Data Assignment. 

In order to create a new tidy dataset
•	Download data files and unzipped in the R working directory specific for this assignment
•	Load R source code called run_analysis.R in to your working directory
•	Execute the code to generate tidy data file

Data description:
Data X contains information on sensor signals measurements obtained from 30 subjects. Data Y contains information on the type of activity study subjects performed
library (dplyr)

Code Description:


1.	Read data relevant to the project assignments from the downloaded files and create tables


2.	Acquire variable names


3. Merge datasets to create training, testing, and subject datasets

3.	Extract measurements on the mean and the standard deviation



4.	5. Use descriptive names for the activities in the dataset
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

####Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5.	Create a new clean dataset with the mean for each activity and subject
